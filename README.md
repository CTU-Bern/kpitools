Tools for creating key performance indicator (KPI) reports.

Example usage
=============

The package can be installed from
[github](https://github.com/CTU-Bern/kpitools) via the `remotes` package

    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("CTU-Bern/kpitools")

Note that `remotes` treats any warnings (e.g.Â that a certain package was
built under a different version of R) as errors. If you see such an
error, run the following line and try again:

    Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS = "true")

And loaded via

    library(kpitools)

The main function is the `kpi` function. A dataframe is passed to it
together with the `var`iable that is of interest for the current KPI. A
summary function also needs to be passed which determines how the KPI is
calculated.

    data(mtcars)

    mtcars$highmpg <- mtcars$mpg > 20

    kpis <- (mtcars %>%
      kpi(var = "highmpg",                          # variable to be summarized (focus of the KPI)  
          kpi_fn = kpi_fn_perc,                     # summary function   
          txt = "Percentage MPG > 20",              # (optional) nicer text to add to tables 
          by = "cyl",                               # (optional) stratifying variable 
          breakpoints = c(0,33.3,66.6,100),         # (optional) cutoff points 
          risklabels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))) # (optional) labels for the cutoff points

There is a plot method for the output from `kpi` which returns a list of
`ggplot2` objects.

    plot <- plot(kpis)
    plot$cyl +
      theme_kpitools()
